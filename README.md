## Authentication

When not in production mode, you will have direct access to log in as any user via a `Dev Login` button on the front-end.

It is not possible to enable Slack to test how an OAuth2 workflow locally as slack blocks `localhost` from being one of the allowed domains. You may, though, create a new branch and push any commits, which will be automatically deployed to the preview environment via Vercel.

## Database schema and migrations

We use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to manage our database schema and migrations.

Should you make any changes to the schema, you can run the following command to update the database tables and columns accordingly:

```bash
yarn db:migrate:local --name <name>
```

where `<name>` is a descriptive name of what was done in the migration in snake_case.
